 I want here to thank You for going through my whole Playground. It was my first more complex than a single Playground for testing frameworks in my life. Even if it doesn't contain any new knowledge for You, I hope that it was pleasant to watch (who doesn't love smooth animations and satisfying group of sorted items?).
 
 I want here to thank Ray Wenderlich's team that shared awesome repo on Github named `Swift Algorithm Club`, because my algorithms are just algorithms from this repo broken to a single steps.
