 # Welcome to The Algorithms Playground!
 
 ## Table of Contents
 
 * [Bubble Sort](Bubble%20Sort)
 * [Insertion Sort](Insertion%20Sort)
 * [Selection Sort](Selection%20Sort)
 
 I am going to present a few basic sorting algorithms to help You to better understand how are they working. The whole process of sorting will be animated using Collection Views with cells colored from white (highest value) to black (lowest value) going through grayscale.
 
 I know that we all here have blazingly fast computers that can execute billions of tasks per second, so to better visualize that I have slowed down sorting to make it smoother and more comfortable for our tired, developer's eyes and I have the hard-coded lowest speed to 0.1s (it's still incredibly low value for our eyes to recognize properly every change!)
 
 In each Playground are variables that You can change to modify given details of the view to better understand how does given algorithm work - you can change the number of elements presented on the view, speed of sorting or type of sorting (sorting from highest to lowest or from lowest to highest). If You will change any of the variables' values when the Playground is running, please recompile Playground to apply changes.
 
 I hope it will be fun for You as much as it was to me while I was creating it :]
